IPT TUTORIAL (M. Rozenberg, modified by L. de' Medici)

GOAL: to run the IPT codes for the (approximate) solution of 
      the Hubbard model in DMFT


* There are 2 codes:
  pertre.f  for real frequency IPT solution
  pertim.f  for imaginary frequency IPT solution


* They respectively have two different `input' files 


The files in detail:

Input file for real axis IPT:

D    = half-bandwidth of semi-circular DOS (Bethe lattice)
xmu0 = initial chemical potential
dmu  = step for the chemical potential variation
nmu  = number of chemical potential points
itu  = flag that selects Temperature or U variation
       itu=0 for U   or   itu=1 for Temperature 
nl   = number of U or Temperaure points
u0   = initial interaction strength U
du   = step for the U variation
t0   = initial Temperature
dt   = step for the Temperature variation
nloop= number of self-concistency iteration loops
imet = choose the initial seed (1=metallic, 0=insulating)
xmix = mixing factor   xmix*new+(1-xmix)*old to ease the iterations and convergence
nl0 = nuber of printed iterations

output files:

for pertre.f:

'rho' is Im[G(w)]   (the DOS up to a factor of pi)
'Sigma' is Re[Sigma(w)], Im[Sigma(w)]
fort.26 is Im[G(w)]  (impurity problem, no self-consistency, imet=1)


for pertim.f

'Gw' has Re[G(iw)],Im[G(iw)]
'G0w' has Re[Go(iw)],Im[Go(iw)]
'Sigma' has Re[Sigma(iw)],Im[Sigma(iw)]
'n_vs_mu' has <n-1/2>, single occupation (per spin)
'double_occ' has <d>, double occupation
'test' has the convergence test as a function of iterations

************************************************************

To compile the code type (filename = pertre or pertim):

gfortran -O3 filename.f -O -o filename

To run the codes type:

./filename

Lets run the codes now

Excercises

1. Run the real-frequency code pertre.f for several values of U (set the 
half-bandwidth D=1) to check out the metal-insulator transition at T=0.
The DOS(w) is written in "rho".
Note that Re[Sigma] is linear for a metal (Fermi liquid)
and that it diverges as 1/w in the insulator.

2. Approach the MIT at Uc_2 \approx 3.D (metal to insulator) from below and observe 
how the different contributions to the DOS (quasiparticle peak and Hubbard
bands) evolve as you get close to the critical value.

3. The effect of the self-consistency condition: For several values of
U (U < Uc_2), run the real-frequency code and compare the output files
"rho" and "fort.26" that contain the converged DOS(w) and the DOS(w)
right after the first iteration. This last quantity corresponds to the solution
of the Single Impurity Anderson Model for a semi-circular conduction band
(within 2nd order perturbation theory of Yamada and Yosida). You can observe
the effect of the self-consistency. 
question: Thinking in terms of the SIAM (or Kondo model) can you try to explain
qualitatively what you see.

4. Using the Matsubara-frequency code, run for several values of U (take 
T=0.001) and observe how the MIT looks like on the imaginary axis.
Note that for different values of U, you should change the number of
iteration loops input parameter `nloop' as suggested at the end of "input".
You may want to compare some Green functions on the real axis and
on the imaginary axis for the same value of U. Also you may check that
the Uc_2 does coincide with the value Uc_2 \approx 3 from real frequency code pertre.f.
Also check that as you approach the Uc_2 from below the w=0 slope of Im[Sigma]
diverges which signals the divergency of the effective mass at the MIT.

5. Using both codes check for the existence of 2 different solutions
at Uc_1 < U <Uc_2 (Uc_1 \approx 2.6, Uc_2 \approx 3.)

6. Comparison between IPT and ED. Run pertim.f for U=2 and T=0.0625.
Compare the results for G(w_n) to ED results for the same value
of the parameters. 
Now set U=4 and compare again.

Optional excercise:
7. Approach the finite T 2nd order critical point (using the Matsubara-
frequency code). Try to obtain the values for Uc and Tc. Watch out for
critical slowing down.
One way to obtain Uc and Tc is to calculate the susceptibility
d<D>/dU (<D> is double occupation "fort.67") and find the point
where this quantity diverges. The behavior is analogous to that of
the classical mean field theory on the ising model in a magnetic
field.
